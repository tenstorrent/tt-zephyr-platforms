config TT_BH_ARC_SCRATCHPAD_SIZE
	hex "Size of scratchpad memory in bytes"
	default 0x9000
	help
	  Size of scratchpad memory in bytes. This is mainly used as a temporary buffer for
	  loading images from SPI flash. The size can be further reduced if we are able to
	  load images in smaller chunks. The default size is 0x9000 bytes, which is enough to
	  load the largest image (ERISC FW) in one go. If using a dynamically allocated
	  buffer is possible, then we can remove the statically allocated buffer entirely.
	  If not, the size would likely only be able to be reduced down to 1 page (4096 bytes).
