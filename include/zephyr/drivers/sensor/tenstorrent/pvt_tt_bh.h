	 *
	 * Values are in raw sensor units (not celcius). Positive delta means the
	 * sensor reads higher than expected, negative means it reads lower.

	 * (22.0C to 28.0C range). If outside this range, the delta remains 0
	 * (no calibration applied).

	 * Array allocation: Static array created per device instance via DEFINE_PVT_TT_BH
	 * Array size: num_ts elements (from devicetree property)
