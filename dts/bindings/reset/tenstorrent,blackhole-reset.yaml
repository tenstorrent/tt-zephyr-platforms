description: |
  The Tenstorrent Blackhole reset controller is used to manage one bank of reset signals occupying
  a 32-bit memory-mapped address.

  There are 3 usage modes.

  1. no mask is specified - 32 reset lines are available to the reset controller instance

    resetX: reset@abcd1234 {
    	compatible = "tenstorrent,blackhole-reset";
     	reg = <0xabcd1234 0x4>;
    	#reset-cells = <1>;
    	status = "okay";
    };

  2. a mask is specified. Only the bits (id values) set high in the mask are valid. In the
    example below, id 1 and id 2 are valid.

    resetX: reset@abcd1234 {
    	compatible = "tenstorrent,blackhole-reset";
     	reg = <0xabcd1234 0x4>;
    	#reset-cells = <1>;
      reset-mask = <0x42>;
    	status = "okay";
    };

  3. a number of resets is specified. In the example below, the least-significant 2 bits are
     available to the reset controller instance. So id 0 and id 1 are valid.

    resetX: reset@abcd1234 {
    	compatible = "tenstorrent,blackhole-reset";
     	reg = <0xabcd1234 0x4>;
    	#reset-cells = <1>;
      nresets = <3>;
    	status = "okay";
    };

  If neither nresets, nor reset-mask is specified, then all 32 reset lines are available.

  Maximally one of nresets or reset-mask may be specified.


properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  nresets:
    type: int
    description: |
      The number of reset lines associated with the reset controller instance.

      This parameter is useful when the lines associated with the reset controller instance are
      contiguous, beginning at bit 0.

      I.e. for nresets = <5>, the value written to the reset register would be equivalent to
      BIT_MASK(5), or 0x1f.

      The valid range for nresets is 0 <= nresets <= 32.

  reset-mask:
    type: int
    description: |
      The bitmask to write to the reset register associated with the reset controller instance.

      This parameter is useful when the lines associated with the reset controller instance are
      non-contiguous.

      I.e. for reset-mask = <0x3fff0000>, only lines 29..16 are affected.
