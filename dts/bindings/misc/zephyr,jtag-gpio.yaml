  This binding is used to describe the JTAG GPIO pins used for JTAG
  communication. The JTAG GPIO pins are used to control the JTAG signals
  (TCK, TDI, TDO, TMS, TRST) for JTAG communication.

include: base.yaml

properties:
  tck-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO pin used for TCK output.

  tdi-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO pin used for TDI output.

  tdo-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO pin used for TDO input.

  tms-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO pin used for TMS output.

  trst-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO pin used for TRST output. Normally, this is active low.

  port-write-cycles:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Number of processor cycles for I/O Port write operations.For example, the
      GPIO clock may be different from the CPU clock. This can usually be
      found in the SoC documentation.

  tck-delay:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Number of microseconds to wait between clock pulses.
