config EXPECTED_READ_TIME
	int "Upper bound on read time for flash device"
	default 1000
	help
	  Expected read time for flash device in milliseconds. This is used to
	  detect performance regressions in the flash driver. This value should
	  be set experimentally when enabling the test, so that any performance
	  drop in the future will be detected.

config EXPECTED_PROGRAM_TIME
	int "Upper bound on program time for flash device"
	default 1000
	help
	  Expected program time for flash device in milliseconds. This is used to
	  detect performance regressions in the flash driver. This value should
	  be set experimentally when enabling the test, so that any performance
	  drop in the future will be detected.

config TEST_BH_ARC
	bool "Test BH ARC Library"
	select NANOPB
	select BH_ARC
	help
	  Test the BH ARC library, rather than Zephyr's flash API. Support
	  for this will be removed in the future, once we remove the
	  BH ARC eeprom code.
