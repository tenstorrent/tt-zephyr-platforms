API Reference
#############

The API reference documents the firmware's public C interfaces for drivers and
libraries, generated from source with Doxygen.

`Browse the full API Reference <doxygen/index.html>`_

.. note::

   To build the API reference locally, run ``make doxygen html`` from the
   ``doc/`` directory. The Doxygen output is copied into the Sphinx build
   so the link above works with a local server.
