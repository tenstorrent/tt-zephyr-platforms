* Going forward, and following the more standard semantic versioning of firmware, the filename
  of the combined firmware bundles will be of the form
  * `fw_pack-<major>.<minor>.<patch>.fwbundle` for final releases, and
  * `fw_pack-<major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc<N>.fwbundle` for release candidates (pre-releases)
