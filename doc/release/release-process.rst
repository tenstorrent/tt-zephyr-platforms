Release Process
###############

This page is intended for Release Managers and describes the release process used by Tenstorrent
firmware.

Release Procedure
*****************

The following steps are required to be followed by firmware release engineers when creating a new
Tenstorrent firmware release.

High Level Process
==================

The release process consists of the following high level steps:

1. Create a release branch from main, and increment the version on main to the next minor version

2. Create a release candiate (RC) from the release branch and post it to GitHub.

3. Announce the RC via internal channels, providing a link to the GitHub release page.

4. Sync with qualification team to kick off qualification testing on the RC.

5. Backport any critical fixes to the release branch.

6. Create new RCs as needed until the RC is validated by the qualification team.

7. Once the final RC has been validated, create a final release and post it to GitHub.

8. Announce the release via internal channels, providing a link to the GitHub release page.


Signed Tags and Immutable Releases
==================================

Tenstorrent firmware uses signed tags and immutable releases to ensure the
integrity of each release. In order to create a signed tag, you must have a
signing key configured in Git. You can verify that your signing key is
configured correctly by running the following commands

.. code-block:: shell

   # Path to signing key should be returned
   git config --global user.signingkey
   # Should return "ssh". GPG keys are supported,
   # but the process is not documented in this guide.
   git config --global gpg.format
   # Provide github CLI with access to the signing keys in your account
   gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:ssh_signing_key
   # Check that you have a signing key available (type MUST be signing)
   gh ssh-key list
   # Check that the signing key you are using matches the key in your account
   cat $(git config --global user.signingkey).pub

You can verify that a tag has been signed correctly by running ``git show`` for
the tag, which should show a signature block in the output (look for the ``BEGIN
PGP SIGNATURE`` or ``BEGIN SSH SIGNATURE`` marker in the output):

For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   tag v19.7.0
   Tagger: Scott Lindsay <slindsay@tenstorrent.com>
   Date:   Wed Mar 11 18:43:17 2026 -0400

   tt-system-firmware 19.7.0
   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

GitHub will show a "Verified" badge for tags that have been signed with a key
that is associated with a GitHub account, and the signature is valid. For
more details, see here:
`GitHub Docs - About commit signature verification <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification>`_.

Testing Release Process
***********************

The release process can be tested by creating a release candidate from a release
branch in a personal fork of the repository, and posting the RC to GitHub as a
pre-release. This allows you to verify that the RC creation and posting process
works correctly, without affecting the main tt-system-firmware repository.

To do so, follow the steps in the `RC Process`_ section, but push the release
branch and RC tag to a personal fork of the repository instead of the main
tt-system-firmware repository. For example,

.. code-block:: shell

   # Run automated RC creation script, specifying your personal fork as the remote
   ./scripts/create-release-candidate.sh git@github.com:<username>/tt-system-firmware.git

Note that the release process requires a few secrets to function correctly.
These can be added within the "Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions" page
of the repository on GitHub. For testing purposes, you can add these secrets to
your personal fork as well.

* ``SIGNATURE_KEY``: This should be the private key used to sign DMFW and CMFW
   during release. To generate, run
   ``openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048 && base64 -i private_key.pem``

* ``PKG_SIGNING_KEY_DEB``: This should be an ASCII-armored GPG key used to
   sign Debian packages during release. To generate, run
   ``--gpg --gen-key`` and follow the prompts to create a new GPG key, then
   export the key with ``gpg --armor --export <key-id>``. Note: the key
   cannot have a passphrase set- just leave the passphrase blank when creating
   the key.


RC Process
==========

Firmware follows a release candidate (RC) process. The RC process is used to
allow for testing and validation of firmware before a final release is made.
Each RC is tagged and posted to GitHub as a pre-release, and the final release
is tagged and posted to GitHub as a stable release.

To start the RC process, perform the following steps:

1. Create a release branch from main with the name ``vX.Y-branch`` where X and Y
   are the major and minor version numbers of the release.

2. Update the MINOR version field, and set the EXTRAVERSION field to "rc1" in
   the release branch. For example, if the release branch is ``v19.9-branch``, then
   the MINOR version should be set to 9 and the EXTRAVERSION field should be set to
   "rc1". This step can be performed using the command
   ``./scripts/update_versions.sh rc``.

3. Tag the release branch with the first RC tag, following the format ``vX.Y.Z-rc1``
   where X, Y and Z are the major, minor and patch version numbers of the release,
   For example, if the release branch is ``v19.9-branch``, then the first RC tag
   should be ``v19.9.0-rc1``. The tag can be created with the command
   ``git tag -s vX.Y.Z-rc1 -m "tt-system-firmware vX.Y.Z-rc1"``, where
   X, Y and Z are the major, minor and patch version numbers of the release.

4. Push the release branch and RC tag to GitHub. This will start the CI process
   for the release from the tag. Once this is complete, follow
   `Posting Release to GitHub`_ steps to post the RC to GitHub as a published
   pre-release.

5. Post a PR incrementing the next minor version on main, and merge after CI is
   successful. For example, if the release branch is ``v19.9-branch``, then the
   version on main should be incremented to 19.10. This step can be performed
   using the command ``./scripts/update_versions.sh post-branch``, then
   creating a PR with the commits it creates.

Automated RC Creation
*********************

.. note::

   The steps below require the GitHub CLI tool to be installed and
   authenticated. You can verify that you are authenticated by running
   ``gh auth status`` and checking that you have access to the repository.
   Installation instructions for the GitHub CLI can be found here:
   `GitHub CLI - Installation <https://github.com/cli/cli#installation>`_

These steps can be automated using the ``scripts/create_release_candidate.sh``
script, which will create the release branch, increment the version on main, tag
the RC, and push the changes to GitHub. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   # You can specify a different remote (i.e. a personal fork) in order to test
   # the script without pushing to the main tt-system-firmware repository.  You
   # can also specify the --dry-run flag to create all relevant branches and
   # tags locally without pushing to GitHub.
   ./scripts/create-release-candidate.sh git@github.com:tenstorrent/tt-system-firmware.git


RC Backports and Validation
===========================

Once the RC is posted to GitHub, it is the responsibility of the release manager
to work with the qualification team to validate the RC. During the RC process,
the following changes are candidates for backporting to the release branch:

.. Note::

   No changes (except version increments) should be made to the release branch
   without also being made to main.

* Critical bug fixes that are required for the RC to pass qualification testing.
  These should be backported to the release branch and included in the next RC.

* Documentation updates for features included in the release. These do not
  require creation of a new RC for validation.

* Features, at the discretion of the release manager and qualification team.

Backports should be made via PRs against the release branch. Any change that is
not documentation updates should trigger a new RC to be created for validation.

Additional RC Process
*********************

To create a new RC for validation after the first RC, follow these steps:

1. Update the EXTRAVERSION field in the release branch to the next RC version
   (e.g. "rc2", "rc3", etc). This step can be performed using the command
   ``./scripts/update_versions.sh update-rc``.

2. Create a PR to the release branch with the change, and merge after CI is
   successful.

3. Tag the release branch with the new RC tag, following the format
   ``vX.Y.Z-rcN`` where X, Y and Z are the major, minor and patch version numbers
   of the release, and N is the RC version number. For example, if the release
   branch is ``v19.9-branch`` and this is the second RC, then the new RC tag should
   be ``v19.9.0-rc2``. The tag can be created with the command
   ``git tag -s vX.Y.Z-rcN -m "tt-system-firmware vX.Y.Z-rcN"``, where X, Y and Z are
   the major, minor and patch version numbers of the release, and N is the RC version number.

4. Push the new RC tag to GitHub. This will start the CI process for the release
   from the new RC tag. Once this is complete, follow `Posting Release to GitHub`_
   steps to post the new RC to GitHub as a published pre-release.


Final Release Process
=====================

Once a final RC has been validated by the qualification team, the release
manager can create the final release. To create the final release, follow these
steps:

1. Update the EXTRAVERSION field in the release branch to be empty. This step can
   be performed using the command ``./scripts/update_versions.sh pre-release``.

2. Tag the release branch with the final release tag, following the format
   ``vX.Y.Z`` where X, Y and Z are the major, minor and patch version numbers of
   the release. For example, if the release branch is ``v19.9-branch``, then the
   final release tag should be ``v19.9.0``. The tag can be created with the command
   ``git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "tt-system-firmware vX.Y.Z"``, where X, Y and Z are the
   major, minor and patch version numbers of the release.

3. Push the release branch and final release tag to GitHub. This will start the CI process
   for the release from the final release tag. Once this is complete, follow
   `Posting Release to GitHub`_ steps to post the final release to GitHub as
   a published stable release.

Posting Release to GitHub
=========================

Once Github actions creates a draft release at `GitHub Releases
<https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-system-firmware/releases>`_,

1. Edit the release. If the release is an RC, mark the release as a pre-release.

2. Verify the release includes a verified tag. There should be a green
   "Verified" badge next to the tag in the release, indicating that the tag is
   signed with a key that is associated with a GitHub account, and the signature is
   valid. If the tag is not verified, do not publish the release and investigate
   the issue.

3. For final releases, copy the contents of the associated release notes template
   (e.g. ``doc/release/release-notes-19.9.md``) into the release notes area.

5. Publish the release. **Note**- since we use immutable releases, once a release
   is published, it cannot be edited.

6. Announce the release candidate via internal channels, providing a link to the
   GitHub release page. Release notes are not required for RCs, but it
   is recommended to link the draft release notes template for the release (e.g.
   ``doc/release/release-notes-19.9.md``) in the RC announcement
