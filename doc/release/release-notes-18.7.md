#### Debug / Developer Features

* The `tenstorrent,vuart` virtual PCIe serial device is now the default for console I/O. The
  virtual uart supports multiple instances, so one instance may be used for console I/O while
  another instance may be used for e.g. RPC, tracing, coredump, profiling, or other
  functionality

* Zephyr's tracing subsystem may now be used over the virtual uart. For now it is limited to a
  an app
  [overlay](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-zephyr-platforms/blob/main/app/smc/tracing.conf)
  but plans are in place to integrate this feature into production firmware with support for
  dynamically configurable tracing
