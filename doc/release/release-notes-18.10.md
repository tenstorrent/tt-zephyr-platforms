[comment]: <> (H3 Performance Improvements, if applicable)
[comment]: <> (H3 New and Experimental Features, if applicable)
[comment]: <> (H3 External Project Collaboration Efforts, if applicable)

### Stability Improvements

* Update Blackhole ERISC FW to v1.6.0
  * Added eth_flush_icache to flush instruction cache for SYS-1944 - function is 2048 NOP instructions unrolled
  * New function pointer in eth_api_table: eth_flush_icache_ptr for aforementioned eth_flush_icache
  * Increased eth code size allocation by 8KB, code now starts at 0x70000
  * Enhanced training flow and retrain logic, links should now more reliably train up
  * Enabled interrupts in erisc fw: now snapshots and clears
  * Added live retraining when check_link_status() detects link down
  * ETH msg LINK_UP_CHECK: fast check to only update rx_link_up field of eth_live_status
* Setup FW table to lower ETH train speeds for Galaxy products to 200G, other products stay 400G
