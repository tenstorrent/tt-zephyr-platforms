[comment]: <> (UL by area, indented as necessary)

* Firmware Versioning: TT Zephyr Platforms has dropped the previous legacy `v80.major.minor.rc` numbering to more traditional [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). E.g.
  * `v18.2.0-rc1` for release candidates
  * `v18.3.0` when the next minor version increases
  * `v19.0.0` when the next major version increases
